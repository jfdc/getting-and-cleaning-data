# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

Introduction
------------
This repo contains the files required in the peer-graded Assignment of week 4 of Getting and Cleaning Data course.

The data for the project can be downloaded from this link:

Purpose
-------
The purpose of the project is to create one R script called **run_analysis.R** that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Components
----------
The repo is composed by the following files:

* **README.md**: this file
* **run_analysis.R**: An R script that defines the run_analysis function that works with the data for the project
* **CodeBook.md**: Describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that are performed in run_analysis.R script and implement the steps defined above
* **output directory**. Contains the files generated by run_analysis.R script:
  * **all_in_one_Dataset.txt**: the result file obtained at the end of step 4
  * **averages_Dataset.txt**: the result file obtained at the end of step 5

Run code
--------
In order to execute the script, download run_analysis.R file and place it in your working directory. From your R IDE execute the following commands:

* source("run_analysis.R")
* run_analysis()

At the end, the script will have generated:

* the "**UCI HAR Dataset.zip**" file downloaded from the link specified at the beginning of this document
* the "**UCI HAR Dataset**" directory result of decompressing the previous zip file
* the **output** directory with the files "**all_in_one_Dataset.txt**" and "**averages_Dataset.txt**"
